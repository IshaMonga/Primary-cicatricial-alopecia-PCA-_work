The primary forms of cicatricial (scarring) alopecia (PCA) are a group of inflammatory, irreversible hair loss disorders characterized by immune cell infiltrates targeting hair follicles (HFs). Lichen planopilaris (LPP), frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) and centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) are among the main subtypes of PCAs. The pathogenesis of the different types of PCAs are poorly understood, and current treatment regimens yield inconsistent and unsatisfactory results.

We performed high-throughput RNA-sequencing on scalp biopsies of a large cohort PCA patients to develop gene expression-based signatures, trained into machine-learning based predictive models and pathways associated with dysregulated gene expression. We performed morphological and cytokine analysis to define the immune cell populations found in PCA subtypes. We identified a common PCA gene signature that was shared between LPP, FFA, and CCCA which revealed a significant over-representation of mast cell genes, as well as downregulation of cholesterogenic pathways and upregulation of fibrosis and immune signaling genes. Immunohistological analyses revealed an increased presence of mast cells in PCAs lesions. Our gene expression analyses revealed common pathways associated with PCAs, with a strong association with mast cells. The indistinguishable differences in gene expression profiles and immune cell signatures between LPP, FFA and CCCA suggest that similar treatment regimens may be effective in treating these irreversible forms of hair loss.

This study provides valuable insight into the gene expression profiles of major PCA variants, lichen planopilaris (LPP), frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), and provides evidence that all three variants share similar pathogenic pathways involving mast cells. These data can be leveraged to design novel therapeutic strategies for PCA patients targeting chlosterogenic pathways, reducing fibrosis, and targeting mast cells.
